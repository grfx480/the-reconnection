<div> Sophie and Sara's friendship had been one of those strong bonds that are rare to find. </div>
<div> They had shared secrets, dreams,and countless memories.However, life's relentless demands had pulled them apart, </div>
<div> and their once-vibrant connectionhad gradually faded into distant memories.</div>
<div> One day, while reminiscing about their shared adventures, Sophie decided it was time to bridge the gap that had formed between them.  </div>
<div> She picked up her phone, fingers trembling with a mix of nostalgia and excitement, and called Sara. </div>
<div> When Sara's familiar voice filled the airwaves, it was as if time had rewound, and they were back to being the ineseparable duo they once were.</div>
<div> "Sara, it's been ages! How have you been?" Sophie exclaimed, her voice laced with genuine warmth.
<div>"Sophie! Oh my godness, it's so good to hear from you!" Sara replied her enthusiasm matching Sophie's. </div>
<div> They exchanged updates about their lives, their voices growing more animated with each shared memory. </div>
